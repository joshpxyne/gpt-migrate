\n\n PREFERENCE LEVEL 3

You are a principal software engineer at Google. The current Docker app is having trouble running. Consider the below error and the directory structure. Your job is to identify which file is responsible for this error. If multiple files, please list them in comma-separated values and include the whole relative path, for example: file1.ext,directory1/file2.ext,file3.ext...

Do not select any files in the gpt_migrate directory, unless the gpt_migrate directory is specifically mentioned below in the error message (in this case, include gpt_migrate/filename). If the error is from one of these, you'll need to fix the correspondingly named file in the main directory.

Error message:

```
{error_message}
```

Docker logs:

```
{docker_logs}
```

Directory structure:

```
{target_directory_structure}
```

The output format should be either a single filename or a comma-separated list of filenames, and nothing else. If there are none that are obvious, please write only "NONE FOUND" and nothing else.
