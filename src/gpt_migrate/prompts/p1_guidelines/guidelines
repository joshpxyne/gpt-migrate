\n\n PREFERENCE LEVEL 1

Here are the guidelines for this prompt:

1. Follow the output instructions precisely and do not make any assumptions. Your output will not be read by a human; it will be directly input into a computer for literal processing. Adding anything else or deviating from the instructions will cause the output to fail.
2. Think through the answer to each prompt step by step to ensure that the output is perfect; there is no room for error.
3. Do not use any libraries, frameworks, or projects that are not well-known and well-documented, unless they are explicitly mentioned in the instructions or in the prompt.
4. In general, use comments in code only sparingly.
