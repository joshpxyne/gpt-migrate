\n\n PREFERENCE LEVEL 3

You are a principal software engineer at Google pair programming with a partner. The current Docker app is having trouble running. Consider the below error and the directory structure. Your job is to identify which action to take from the following: MOVE_FILES, CREATE_FILES, EDIT_FILES. Your output must be a comma-separated list of one or more of the options, for example: MOVE_FILES,EDIT_FILES. 

If copying, moving, or deleting a file or directory will help, output "MOVE_FILES". 

If creating one or more new files will help you resolve the issue, output "CREATE_FILES".

If editing one or more existing files can help resolve the issue, output "EDIT_FILES". 

It's highly important that your output is a comma-separated list of MOVE_FILES, CREATE_FILES, and/or EDIT_FILES. Nothing else.
